# Auto-Service-Sales

I developed an auto service and sales project using C# and .NET 8 with Areas, which includes both an admin panel and a user panel. I also implemented data exchange with the database using Entity Framework and MS SQL Server. In the project, vehicle images are uploaded via sliders and have automatic motion capability. The main goal of this project was to create a user-friendly auto service and sales website, and I have successfully achieved that goal.
